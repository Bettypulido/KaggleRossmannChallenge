*Title: The Kaggle Rossmann challenge: Gradient boosting vs. deep learning*

*Contents: Ipython slideshow + helper functions*

We took part in the [Kaggle Rossmann Store Sales challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). Despite not having impressive scores on the Leaderboard, we have learnt a lot, tried a different things, experimented, were creative. In this slideshow we compare Gradient Boosting based mostly on the scikit implementation and Neural networks based on theano and keras. 

Feel free to use our slides and share your opinion
